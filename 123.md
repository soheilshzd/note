### important parts of andres thesis

The main objective of this work is to develop methods for the dexterous in-hand manipulation of unknown objects using robotic hands with tactile sensors.

## day 3

Despite the soft-finger contact model is more accurate than the other contact models, the frictional point contact model is the most
used in the field of robotic grasping because it presents a lower complexity and time-consuming restrictions in the simulation of the contact behavior (Le√≥n et al. 2014) and the application results are good enough.
